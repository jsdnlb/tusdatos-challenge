# Tusdatos Challenge

This project consists of two parts, the first will be hosted in the web_scrapping folder where the exercise is documented in a Jupiter notebook to make it easier to test, the second consists of the entire project in general where all the information is exposed using a pager simple, order the information, order by and search for a specific field for a specific value, currently it only works with strings; Additionally, authorization and authentication was implemented with json web token, for testing the unittest library was used with its respective mocks and finally a non-relational database with MongoDB was used.

**Note:** To consume the judicial processes API it is necessary to have an administrator role, to access the user API you will simply need a user and that it be active,

## How to start?üöÄ

_These instructions will allow you to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes._

### Installation üîß

First of all we must clone the repository and after that we must create a virtual environment to install all the necessary libraries

```
python3 -m venv venv # Create virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate # Activate environment, may vary in other os
```

Once the environment is active we can install requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

With this we would have everything necessary to run the project.

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Running tests ‚öôÔ∏è

To run a specific test section

```
python tests/test_delete_processes.py 
```

To run a all tests section

```
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
